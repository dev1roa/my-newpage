            Mortred, the Phantom Assassin, is a melee agility hero fitting the role of hard carry. Mortred is
            best-known, and infamous for, her ability to inflict staggering damage with single strikes. Her abilities
            synergize supremely well with each other, rendering her an extremely formidable foe once she has acquired
            the items she requires. She is a very farm-dependent melee Hero, but she farms creeps with much more ease
            than many of her fellow carries, using her Stifling Dagger for last hitting. Besides eliminating the
            weakness most melee Heroes have in their farming, her second ability, Phantom Strike, acts as both her
            escape and initiate, while Blur gives her an edge against other Heroes that depend on their physical attacks
            by evading them; giving her partial damage immunity to many carries. Her ultimate, the strongest critical
            strike in the game, is what connects Mortred with four-digit damage and what gives her a place amongst the
            very best support killers in the late game, since they usually fall instantly from the divine strike her
            ultimate provides. Mobile and able to fight back nearly every enemy that dares to face her, Mortred is a
            formidable foe that should never be underestimated, and with appropriate item choices and a few kills, she
            can snowball out of control and become next to impossible to stop.

            <div style="display: table-cell; font-style: italic;">Through a process of divination, children are selected
                for upbringing by the Sisters of the Veil, an order that considers assassination a sacred part of the
                natural order. The Veiled Sisters identify targets through meditation and oracular utterances. They
                accept no contracts, and never seem to pursue targets for political or mercenary reasons. Their killings
                bear no relation to any recognizable agenda, and can seem to be completely random: A figure of great
                power is no more likely to be eliminated than a peasant or a well digger. Whatever pattern the killings
                may contain, it is known only to them. They treat their victims as sacrifices, and death at their hand
                is considered an honor. Raised with no identity except that of their order, any Phantom Assassin can
                take the place of any other; their number is not known. Perhaps there are many, perhaps there are few.
                Nothing is known of what lies under the Phantom Veil. Except that this one, from time to time, when none
                are near enough to hear, is known to stir her veils with the forbidden whisper of her own name: Mortred.
